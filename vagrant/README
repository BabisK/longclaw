CREATES A VAGRANT ENVIRONMENT TO FACILITATE LOCAL TESTING

========
USAGE:
========
cd to this directory and then issue the following commands:
    vagrant up
    vagrant ssh
    cd /vagrant
    tox

    
IF THIS IS VERY SLOW DUE TO NPM INSTALL, I LIKE TO DO THE FOLLOWING TO INSTALL NPM DEPS OUTSIDE OF THE SHARED FOLDER:
    rsync --recursive --exclude="*/node_modules/*" --exclude="*/.git/*" /vagrant /tmp
    cd /tmp/vagrant
    tox
